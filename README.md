E-Commerce Sales Insights & Analytics Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive React-based Analytics Suite designed to simulate a complete data analysis workflow. It bridges the gap between raw data handling and strategic decision-making by integrating a Data Engine, a SQL Query Simulator, and an Interactive Dashboard.

The application analyzes e-commerce sales data to identify revenue growth opportunities, optimize product strategies, and calculate key metrics like Average Order Value (AOV) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

🎯 Key Objectives

Data Simulation: Generate and manage realistic e-commerce transaction datasets.

Querying: specific data segments using a built-in SQL simulator.

Visualization: Render real-time insights on sales trends and product performance using custom-built SVG charts.

Decision Support: Provide actionable metrics to drive marketing and pricing strategies.

🚀 Features

1. Interactive Dashboard (Tableau-Style)

KPI Cards: Real-time tracking of Total Revenue, AOV, Active Customers, and Order Volume.

Visualizations: Custom-coded SVG Line Charts (Revenue Trends) and Bar Charts (Top Products).

Category Analysis: Breakdown of sales performance by product category.

2. SQL & Data Playground

Raw Data Viewer: Inspect the underlying dataset generated by the engine.

Query Simulator: Simulate SQL queries (e.g., SELECT * FROM sales WHERE total > 500) to filter data and understand segmentation logic.

Data Cleaning: Automatic formatting of dates and currency values.

3. Dynamic Data Engine

Mock Generator: Creates a realistic dataset of hundreds of transactions, including products, regions, timestamps, and customer IDs, every time the app loads.

Performance: Uses useMemo for efficient data aggregation and calculation on the client side.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend Framework: React.js (Hooks: useState, useEffect, useMemo)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Responsive Grid/Flexbox layouts)

Icons: Lucide React

Visualization: Custom SVG implementations (No external charting libraries used for maximum performance)

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript for data processing (Simulation of SQL logic via array methods)

📊 Analytics Logic

This project implements core data analysis concepts directly in JavaScript:

AOV (Average Order Value): Total Revenue / Total Orders

Trend Analysis: Aggregating transaction arrays by Month/Year buckets.

SQL Simulation:

WHERE clauses are simulated using Array.prototype.filter().

ORDER BY clauses are simulated using Array.prototype.sort().

📷 Usage Guide

Dashboard View: Use this tab to see the high-level executive summary. Hover over charts to see specific data points.

Data & Querying View: Switch to this tab to act as a Data Analyst. Click the pre-defined query buttons (e.g., "High Value Orders") to see how filtering affects the dataset table.
